HelpDesk - A Better Bookmark Manager
========

Create a more intuitive way to organize bookmarks. To me that means to make it more graphical and interactive.
(Chrome Extension)

Ideas:
- Implement a drag and drop system much like on a desktop; good for a few reasons: it's familiar and it "physicalizes" bookmarks
and makes them tangible, instead of just a link.

- Better Tracibility
    -store additional information besides just the link, such as the history that lead to that bookmark (make
    this graphical too, thinking of a branching tree structure (could also edit the history))
    -Add notes
    -Add snapshot of the page
    
-Implement with Chrome sync
-Have local copy



Libraries:
- Looking at a few graphical libraries to make things easier: SnapSVG, Draw2D, RaphaelJS
